Social Blog website and database.

This project was developed in the first semester of my second year at university as part of the "Databases and Web Applications" module.
The database is run by XAMPP which uses apache web server and mySQL backend server to handle the database queries.
The websites provides CRUD functionality for the database in the form of;
- Adding new users, posts, and comments.
- Reading and displaying users posts and comments.
- Editing and updating a users post, comment, and personal profile details.
- Deleting a post or comment.
